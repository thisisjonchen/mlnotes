## What is Machine Learning?
Arthur Samuel, a pioneer in CS + AI in his time, defined machine learning as "...[the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed" (1959). He helped evolve AI by writing the first checkers-playing game that learned from thousands of games against itself.

Machine Learning Algorithms
- Supervised Learning (*Used in most real-world applications/rapid advancements)
- Unsupervised Learning
- Recommender Systems
- Reinforcement Learning

## Supervised Learning
`(DEF)` Supervised Learning: Learning via input (x) to output mappings.
Key characteristic: **Learns from being given examples and the "right answers".**

Given input(s), the algorithm will make a "guess" and output based on what it had previously learned.

Some examples Andrew provided:
| Input (X) | Output (Y)  | Application  |
|---|---|---|
|  email | spam? (0/1)  | spam filtering  |
| audio  |  text transcripts |  speech recognition |
|  ad, user info | click? (0/1)  |  online advertising |
| image, radar info | position of other cars | self-driving car |

`(DEF)` **Regression**: Predict a number from infinitely many possible outputs.
- Ex: Housing Market Crisis
  
`(DEF)` **Classification**: 
- Ex: Breast Cancer Detection
